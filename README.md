# Crowfunding_ETl
For the ETL mini project, we work to practicse buliding an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods ro regular expressions to extract and transform data. After transfrom data, we create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
